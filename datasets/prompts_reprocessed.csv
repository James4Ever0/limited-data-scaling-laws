0,This machine broke after 3 times. I tried to return it to the seller but it says &#34;no return&#34; when I try.

(well a little waiting, it is sno cones after all!)",B
1,We received the unit 2 weeks before the promised shipping date.  The size is what we wanted and looks great and will be a geat addition to our down stairs rec. room.,"It is way too loud!!!!  If you are buying this to be used in the house, don't buy it. Way too loud!!!!<br /><br />We just leave it outside in our backyard. For that purpose, I think it is okay.",A
2,Love it! Easy to use and pays for it self in no time:) Everyone should have one of these Easy Go Washers:) Learned how to make my own soap too which also saves me money:),Drain spout broke after first use--spout tube separated from coupler/bushing that plunges into main body drain hole. Poor quality. Send a replacement drain spout if you have any integrity.,A
3,I researched a lot before buying this and unfortunately the negative reviews about how it doesn't clean the dishes turned out to be right (although installation was no prob).,So I have to say -- this ... thing ... is ... awesome.  We've used it for a couple years now -- and it's still going strong.  LOVE THIS MACHINE.  I highly recommend.,B
4,I install this filter on kenmore refergerator repacing oe part # 46-9930 two days later the filter pop out by itself.

Save me a ton of money on a repair man and made me feel like a real Mr Fix It!!,B
7,"My knees seem to feel better. Today is 9-6-2015. The Knee Sleeves are fading, and they were not even washed yet. I feel that this happened that I should get another pair at no cost.","I thought this was to relieve pain and keep knee secured, but instead it feels like a legging on half of my leg. It still does not secure my knee to where I will feel it is safe to run/walk.",A
8,"I love it. As good as the factory filter, maybe better. Don't buy the HDX home depot brand, flow rate is reduced to less that 50%, and they cost more than the Waterfall filter.","Read some of the reviews about leaking but still gave it a shot.  Was pleased with speed of delivery, but have noticed significant leaking.  Will stick to ordering the brand name.",A

11,"The oven  stopped working  1 month after I got it, Samsung is unhelpful, a repair guy came said he fixed it. It is still not working,<br />I have been chasing Samsung for 2 weeks.",We love it. It works perfectly. The only thing I didn't realize until we got it is there is no timer on it that you can use alone without using the microwave itself.,B
12,I give this a 5 star great little dishwasher.  If you don't have a lot off room perfect for you.  Clans excellent.  Works as well as the full size.  Very quiet.,It leaks in several places and cant find away to contact seller it does however clean the dishes well but has destoyed my counter top ! also would like to add that my counter was level .,A
13,"All manual' ! Wasting my time, I don't know there is a stone age washing on this century. The only advantage is that the dry effect is good, the clothes do not drop'","This works for what I need. I have no washer and dryer hookup, so I use this in my bathroom. That way I don't have to lug it up up and down the stairs and I don't have to go to the laundromat.",B
14,"This is a gimmick. Don't buy it. I was duped by the reviews, but it really doesn't do much except give you some energy.

My address is 525 Argyle Ave. Orange New Jersey  07050,B
15,Prompt delivery and great looking microwave. I cannot wait to try out grill function.

I feel sick as I am writing this review, I did file a return and order the OEM immediately.",works just as good as the original filter that came with the fridge... if your looking ways to save money on outrages filters this is the way to do it ...,B
18,Absolutely terrible you cant even fit a normal size box of tissue in it at all.  I wanted to send it back but it was past the allowable date to do so.  A total waste of my money.,Just adorable!!  You have to take the tissues out of the original cardboard box and install them in the holder.  Looks alto better than the tissue cardboard boxes around the house!,B
19,"Purchasing and pickup were flawless and I couldn't be happier with the machine. Fits perfectly in my small home, it's easy to use and washes like a champ.

22,Fixed the sqeeling noise (idle pulley) and while I had the machine apart replaced rollers and belt. Fit perfect Whirlpool front load. also great price.,The rollers smell like burning tires. Avoid this kit despite the excellent value. I found a kit with rollers that were the same diameter but didn't smell like a tire fire.,A
23,"Replaced this unit 8/2014, and here we are again. The longevity is lacking contrasted the original which lasted about 20 years. Ill give it a second go.",Does the job on my Series 80 Kenmore washer. Save the metal bracket from your old unit as this one does not come with one. Can't beat the price and it shipped quickly.,B

Does what it's supposed to do, which is keep bottled water cold upstairs.",in all my time in amazon since 08 this is my first bad electronic review. It didn't even work for up to 24 hrs I advice people to pay a lil more for something that will work,A
25,"We used this airbed for three nights and all three nights we needed to add air to the bed.  More so, we had to add air 2-3 times throughout the night.  :(","Inexpensive, great quality, super comfortable, and happy relatives. I put a memory foam mattress topper on top and you can't even tell it's an air mattress.",B
26,It came with a dent in the door frame. . . since I was keeping it in the garage I didn't think it was worth the inconvenience or returning it.<br />It seems to be working well. . .,Purchased one about 10 mos ago. It just gave out and died. I would not recommend it. Also it is fairly loud. Amazon will not accept a return so: I lose.,A

Even after mixing it with frozen blueberries and banana it was still tough to choke down.,I have purchased this more than once and I really enjoy it. I like a shake for breakfast and I feel like I am doing something healthy for my body. It holds me over until lunch. I will buy it again.,B

Oh, my husband cut thin wood for stability on the shelves in case i put weight, will be fine without too though.",This is the second one I was buying. The first one was great. The second one is not sturdy and small. Charging same price and not getting what I paid for.,A
